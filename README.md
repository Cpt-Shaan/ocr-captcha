# ocr-captcha
work done by me to apply OCR on image based captchas. 
Note : All work in this repo has been done keeping the accesibility for the blind in mind. Hence all my iterations involve a pre-trained kokoro-TTS pipeline to convert the captchas to speech. 

 - Initial Version - Accpets captcha image, converts to text via CRNN, and converts to speech via kokoro. 
 - In development - StreamlitUI / Gradio based application for hosting and inferencing. 
 - Further Versions (todo) - To work for multiple types of captchas (aritmetic solvers, finding particular letters from captcha) ,host as a chrome extension ,etc.
